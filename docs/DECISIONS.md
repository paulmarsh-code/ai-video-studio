## D11: Animatic-to-rough-cut in Phase 2

When a Kling take is approved, it replaces its storyboard panel in the animatic timeline. The storyboard reel gradually becomes the finished episode, keeping the original timing and structure. Within the app, the workflow then runs continuously from story idea to final edit.

Requirements:

- **Slot replacement.** An approved take fills the picture slot of its linked panel through the panel ID and shot ID link (Stage 4A.3).
- **Length mismatch.** By default the take is trimmed, or its last frame held, so the episode timing stays locked. The user can choose to ripple the later clips instead. A take is never stretched or slowed without the user knowing.
- **Audio.** The slot switches from preview audio to the take's Kling native audio. Panels that have no approved take keep their placeholder or browser voice, so the reel always plays from start to end.
- **Versions.** The storyboard-only animatic is kept. A toggle switches between "Storyboard" and "Current cut". Each swap creates a new animatic version.
- **Progress.** The view shows, for example, "12 of 15 shots approved", with unapproved slots marked.
- **Export.** The MP4 export of the current cut uses the same ffmpeg pipeline as the animatic. The "ANIMATIC: NOT FINAL" watermark appears only while placeholder slots remain.

Acceptance tests (to be added to spec §6):

- **AT-21:** Approve a take for C4a. The C4a panel in the Scene 1 animatic is replaced by the take with its native audio. The total scene runtime does not change (trim/hold mode).
- **AT-22:** Switch to ripple mode with a take that is 0.4 s longer than its panel. Every later clip shifts by 0.4 s, and the scene runtime grows by 0.4 s.
- **AT-23:** Toggle between "Storyboard" and "Current cut". Both play correctly, and the storyboard-only version is unchanged.

Phase 2 exit evidence: each Paid On Time episode from 2 to 4 is shown progressing from a storyboard reel to the finished cut in the same timeline. This is also captured as marketing material.
